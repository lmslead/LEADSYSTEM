## Reporting Considerations

### Stats & Analytics
- Track "DO NOT CALL" requests for compliance
- Monitor "No Answer" vs "Hang-up" rates
- Identify "Existing Client" inquiries
- Measure "Affordability" as disqualification reason
- Analyze "Not Serviceable State" for expansion planning

### Conversion Funnel
1. Initial Contact → No Answer / Hang-up
2. Engaged → Not Interested / Not Qualified / Affordability
3. Qualified → Sale Long Play / Callback Needed
4. Enrolled → Immediate Enrollment
5. Special Cases → Existing Client / AIP Client

## Compliance Notes

### DO NOT CALL Flags
- **DO NOT CALL - Litigator**: Highest priority, legal protection required
- **DO NOT CALL**: Standard DNC request, must be honored

These flags should trigger:
- Automatic contact suppression
- Compliance reporting
- Legal risk mitigation
