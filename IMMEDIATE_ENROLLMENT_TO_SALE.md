```

**Line ~583 - Conversion Rate Comment:**
```javascript
// BEFORE
// Calculate conversion rate: (Immediate Enrollment call disposition leads ÷ Qualified leads) × 100

// AFTER
// Calculate conversion rate: (SALE call disposition leads ÷ Qualified leads) × 100
```

## Conversion Rate Formula

### Unchanged Logic
The conversion rate calculation formula remains exactly the same, just using "SALE" instead of "Immediate Enrollment":

```
Conversion Rate = (Number of SALE leads ÷ Number of Qualified leads) × 100
```

### Where It's Calculated

1. **AdminDashboard.js** (Line ~826):
   ```javascript
   const calculatedConversionRate = qualifiedLeads > 0 
     ? parseFloat(((immediateEnrollmentLeads / qualifiedLeads) * 100).toFixed(2)) 
     : 0;
   ```

2. **Server routes/leads.js** (Line ~1836 & ~1863):
   ```javascript
   const conversionRate = qualified > 0 
     ? ((immediateEnrollment / qualified) * 100).toFixed(2) 
     : 0;
   ```

3. **Server models/Lead.js** (Line ~584-586):
   ```javascript
   result.conversionRate = result.qualifiedLeads > 0 
     ? ((result.immediateEnrollmentLeads / result.qualifiedLeads) * 100).toFixed(2)
     : 0;
   ```

## Variable Names

### Note on Internal Variable Names
The internal variable name `immediateEnrollmentLeads` was **intentionally kept** for these reasons:
1. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing API responses use this field name
2. **Database Field**: No need to migrate existing data
3. **Less Breaking Changes**: Frontend code expecting this field name continues to work
4. **Clear Mapping**: Variable name doesn't have to match the UI label

The variable stores counts of "SALE" status leads, but maintains the old variable name to avoid breaking changes.

## Backward Compatibility

### ✅ Full Backward Compatibility Maintained

1. **Existing Leads with "Immediate Enrollment"**:
   - Will continue to display correctly
   - Can be viewed and edited
   - Pass validation (accepts any string for backward compatibility)
   - Are treated as legacy data

2. **Database**:
   - No migration required
   - Existing `leadProgressStatus` values preserved
   - New leads will use "SALE"
   - Old leads can be updated to "SALE" if needed

3. **API Responses**:
   - `immediateEnrollmentLeads` field name unchanged
   - Existing integrations continue to work
   - No breaking changes to API contracts

## Migration Notes

### No Database Migration Required

Since the validation accepts any string value for backward compatibility, no database migration is necessary. However, if you want to update all existing records:

```javascript
// Optional: Update all existing "Immediate Enrollment" records to "SALE"
db.leads.updateMany(
  { leadProgressStatus: 'Immediate Enrollment' },
  { $set: { leadProgressStatus: 'SALE' } }
);
```

**Note**: This migration is **OPTIONAL** and not required for the system to work correctly.

   - `server/models/Lead.js`

2. Restart the application

3. Optionally run database migration to revert any "SALE" records:
   ```javascript
   db.leads.updateMany(
     { leadProgressStatus: 'SALE' },
     { $set: { leadProgressStatus: 'Immediate Enrollment' } }
   );
   ```
